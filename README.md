## What is it?
_Sequential structures_ in JavaScript represent the most basic type of flow control within a program.

In a _sequential structure_, code is executed **line by line**, in the order it is written, without jumps or deviations.

These structures are especially useful for operations that require instructions to be performed in an exact, direct sequence

## About this repo:
This repository was created with the aim of studying and practicing JavaScript, maintaining a solid foundation for improved performance in the future.

The exercises are taken from the [DevSuperior](https://devsuperior.com.br/) course and solved using JavaScript in VSCode.

## About me:
Hi! I'm Mariana. I started my programming journey in 2021, and I'm really enjoying it.

At the moment, I work as a Front-End Developer, but it's never too much to keep practicing the basics. I hope you enjoy it, and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariana-savoldi-pereira/) is my LinkedIn if you want to contact me :)
